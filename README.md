# Data Engineering Pipelines

A collection of data engineering projects focused on building pipelines to handle data from various sources, apply complex transformations, and efficiently load and store data using a variety of technologies. These pipelines utilize SQL/NoSQL databases, big data tools (Kafka, Spark, etc.), and cloud solutions to manage data processing tasks at scale. Each project provides a unique data engineering solution with practical applications in industry and academia.

## Projects

### 1. [E-Patent (Patent Analysis)](https://github.com/hamzaae/Big-Data-Project-Patent-Analysis)
An academic project analyzing patents related to Artificial Intelligence in education, aiming to provide insights through a user-friendly web application. Key features include:

- **Data Collection**: Gathers data through APIs and web scraping.
- **Storage**: Uses MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and HDFS for data storage.
- **Transformation**: Utilizes Apache Spark for data processing.
- **Visualization**: Implements Flask for the frontend and PowerBI for data visualization.

The goal is to deliver both personalized and general analyses of patents, making research more accessible.

### 2. [Real-Time People Count Pipeline](https://github.com/hamzaae/Real_Time_People_Monitor)
A Lambda architecture pipeline designed to count people in various zones of a market in real-time, generating valuable insights based on the flow of individuals. Main features:

- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 with Python to detect and count people.
- **Big Data Tools**: Processes and streams data with Kafka, HDFS, and Spark.
- **Workflow Management**: Utilizes Apache Airflow for scheduling tasks.
- **Visualization**: Data insights visualized in Power BI.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized for easy deployment.

This project demonstrates the use of real-time data processing for operational intelligence in commercial settings.

### Other Notable Projects

- **GitHub Trending Repos**: Analyzes popular repositories on GitHub to provide insights into trending projects.
- **Avito Product Tracking**: Tracks product data on Avito to identify trends and pricing dynamics.
